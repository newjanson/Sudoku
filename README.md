Individual Contributions:

Yaman Abouyouniss:

For this project, I worked on the backend components of the code. I spent much of my time attempting to create a completely random board generator. However it was too buggy to use in the master branch of the code so I chose another strategy for board generation. I collected free online sudokuboards and placed this dataset into the project folder. This consisted of creating a 2D list using one of the .txt files in the board. I also created a random string generator which chooses a random board from the dataset to use as the gameboard. Lastly, I created the method which checks if the win condition has been reached. My contribution to the README file was that I wrote the installation guide.

Aditya Arora:
For this project, I worked on the frontend/visual components of the code (specifically, the main menu). I spent my time creating the main menu and integrating the buttons to work together when launching the application. Unfortunately, due to time purposes our team has decided to keep the main menu separate from the game itself and let other users who want to contribute to our game take over and integrate it themselves (consider it a challenge). I also helped the team schedule meetings and supported my other team members when they needed help during the project.
